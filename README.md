# Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Assignment 1

Implementation and visualization of algorithms to find Strongly Connected Components in a Directed Graph.

## Algorithms Implemented

* [Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229023670_A_divide-and-conquer_algorithm_for_identifying_strongly_connected_components) - a *O(ElogV)* algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph.

* [Kosaraju's Algorithm (Classical)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm) - a *O(V)* algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph.

NOTE:   V-number of vertices & 
        E-number of edges

## Vizualization

Vizualization Library - [ElGrapho](https://www.elgrapho.com/)

* Vizualization of [WikiVote](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html) data with strongly connected components - [Here](./viz/graph_viz.html)
